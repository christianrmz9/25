- Configure ESLint to enforce consistent coding style across the project for better maintainability
- Use ESLint plugins specific to your tech stack (e.g., vue, typescript) to catch framework-specific issues
- Implement custom rules for project-specific requirements to ensure adaptability to your project's needs
- Regularly update ESLint configuration to align with best practices and improve code quality over time
- Use ESLint fix command to automatically fix minor issues and improve development efficiency
