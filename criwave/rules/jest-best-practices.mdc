- Write tests for all components and utility functions to ensure comprehensive coverage
- Use shallow mounting for isolating component tests to improve test performance
- Mock external dependencies and APIs to create reliable and adaptable tests

- Use code coverage reports to identify untested areas and improve overall test quality
