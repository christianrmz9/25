- Keep the state as simple as possible to improve performance and maintainability
- Use mutations for synchronous operations and actions for asynchronous ones to maintain predictable state changes
- Implement proper namespacing for modules in larger applications to avoid naming conflicts
- Use getters for computed state to optimize performance by caching derived state
- Avoid direct state mutations outside of mutations to maintain a single source of truth
