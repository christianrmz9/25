- Use single-file components (.vue files) for better organization and performance
- Implement proper prop validation and default values to enhance component reusability
- Utilize Vue's reactivity system effectively with computed properties and watchers for optimal performance
- Use v-if for conditional rendering when elements may be removed, and v-show for toggling visibility to improve performance
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks in methods to prevent app crashes
